## üìå Overview and Important Guidelines

Due to limited space in the `/home` directory, **all students must work in the shared directory**:

```
/shared/BIOE486/SP25/
```

**IMPORTANT RULES:**

- **Always use your own folder (`$USER`)** within this shared directory.
- **NEVER modify or delete other users' folders or files** to avoid conflicts.
- **Share common datasets** in the designated shared dataset directory (`/shared/BIOE486/SP25/dataset`).

---

## üõ† Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ **Create Personal Working Directory**

Use your login username (`$USER`) to create your own workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p /shared/BIOE486/SP25/users/$USER
mkdir -p /shared/BIOE486/SP25/venvs/$USER
```

Verify your username:

```bash
echo $USER
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Create Python Virtual Environment**

Run this command to create your own Python virtual environment (`env`):

```bash
python3 -m venv /shared/BIOE486/SP25/venvs/$USER/env
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Activate Virtual Environment**

Activate your virtual environment each time you work:

```bash
source /shared/BIOE486/SP25/venvs/$USER/env/bin/activate
```

Your terminal prompt will now start with `(env)`.

---

### ‚úÖ **Upgrade pip**

After activating your environment, upgrade pip immediately:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Always upgrade pip if prompted.

---

### ‚úÖ **Install PyTorch (GPU-enabled)**

Our system has GPUs available. Install GPU-enabled PyTorch easily with:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Install Other Essential ML Packages**

Install additional essential ML packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Good vs. Bad Package Installation Examples**

To avoid conflicts and issues, carefully follow the correct practice:

- **‚úÖ GOOD Example (Correct Practice)**

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
source /shared/BIOE486/SP25/venvs/$USER/env/bin/activate

# Install within your activated environment
pip install matplotlib
```

- **‚ùå BAD Example (Incorrect Practice)**

```bash
# Never install packages directly (without activation)
pip install matplotlib
```

or

```bash
# Never use sudo or global installs
sudo pip install matplotlib
```

Incorrect methods affect everyone's environment and can cause conflicts.

---

### ‚úÖ **Verify PyTorch Installation**

Check your installation and GPU availability:

```bash
python
```

Within Python, run:

```python
import torch
print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA (GPU) Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
```

Example Output:

```
PyTorch version: 2.3.0
CUDA (GPU) Available: True
```

Exit Python with:

```python
exit()
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Run Jupyter Notebooks**

Create your own notebooks directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
mkdir -p /shared/BIOE486/SP25/users/$USER/notebooks

jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888 --notebook-dir=/shared/BIOE486/SP25/users/$USER/notebooks
```

Follow instructor-provided instructions for remote browser access.

---

### ‚úÖ **Deactivate Environment**

When finished, deactivate your environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## üìÅ Dataset Sharing Guidelines

You are encouraged to share common datasets. Store them clearly labeled within:

```
/shared/BIOE486/SP25/dataset
```

- Check existing datasets first to avoid duplicates.
- Clearly name and document datasets so others can understand and use them easily.

Example of good practice:

```
/shared/BIOE486/SP25/dataset/cifar10/
/shared/BIOE486/SP25/dataset/human-cell-images/
```

---

## üöß Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied Issues:** Immediately notify the instructor or TA.
- **GPU Not Available:** Ensure you used the correct installation command and verify with the PyTorch installation verification step.
- **Limited Space Errors:** Report to the instructor right away.

## üéØ **Final Reminders**

- Always work and install packages within your activated virtual environment.
- Maintain your workspace clean and avoid modifying others‚Äô environments.
- Share datasets thoughtfully in the provided shared directory.
